Week 1 homework - OTJ ticket

## Description

The purpose of this project was to make a provided web page more accessible to the public and to other web developers by adding alternate information and combining lengthy code into smaller segments.

I learned how to:

<ul>
    <li>Combine CSS elements with like attributes into a few lines of code instead of dozens</li>
    <li>Fix a broken hyperlink by adding a missing element ID</li>
    <li>Add appropriate img alt text by following web accessibility guidelines</li>
    <li>Create an image hyperlink in a markdown file</li>
</ul>

## Usage

Click one of the three hyperlinks at the top of the page to jump down the page to their descriptive content.
